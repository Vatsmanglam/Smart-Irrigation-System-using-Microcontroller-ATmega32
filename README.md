# Smart Irrigation System using Microcontroller ATmega32

## Overview

The Smart Irrigation System is an innovative project designed to automate the irrigation process using the ATmega32 microcontroller. This system aims to optimize water usage in agriculture by monitoring soil moisture levels and controlling irrigation accordingly.

## Features

- **Soil Moisture Monitoring**: Continuously measures soil moisture levels to determine irrigation needs.
- **Automated Irrigation Control**: Automatically activates or deactivates the irrigation system based on moisture readings.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple interface for users to monitor and control the irrigation system.
- **Energy Efficient**: Designed to minimize water wastage and ensure efficient water usage.

## Technologies Used

- **Microcontroller**: ATmega32 for controlling the irrigation system.
- **Sensors**: Soil moisture sensors for real-time monitoring.
- **Relay Module**: To control the water pump or irrigation valves.
- **Programming Language**: C for programming the microcontroller.

## Installation

To set up the Smart Irrigation System, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kanhaiyakumar1838/Smart-Irrigation-System-using-Microcontroller-ATmega32
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Smart-Irrigation-System-using-Microcontroller-ATmega32
   ```

3. **Hardware Setup**: Connect the ATmega32 microcontroller, soil moisture sensors, and relay module as per the circuit diagram provided in the repository.

4. **Upload Code**: Use an appropriate programmer to upload the code to the ATmega32 microcontroller.

5. **Power the System**: Ensure the system is powered correctly to start monitoring and controlling irrigation.

## Usage

Once the system is set up and powered, it will automatically monitor the soil moisture levels. When the moisture falls below a predefined threshold, the irrigation system will activate, ensuring optimal watering of plants.
